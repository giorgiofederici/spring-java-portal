#About
sjp.about.section.one.title = About
sjp.about.section.one.description = I graduated from Sapienza, University of Rome with a Bachelor and Master's degree. I am passionate about technology and have been since my childhood - I used to spend most of my time playing videogames. With my degree I turned this passion into a profession: computers and IT assist me to share my creative and innovative ideas, while engineering studies help me to think outside the box. I am never satisfied about what I know and I always try to learn new things. I think this is the only way to broaden my career path following what I like and improving what I do. So far, I am a developer but I would like to use my engineering knowledge more, in order to create new software architectures and standards. After my graduation, I have worked in Sogetel S.r.l. (Rome, Italy) for 1 year as a Java programmer and web application developer. I have had to deal with many of the various problems and difficult situations that can arise during development and release process - lack of time, change of requirements, internal problems with technologies. Then, to improve my English level, I have studied at Atlantic Language School (www.atlanticlanguage.com) in Galway, Ireland. In June 2014, I went back to Italy and started to work for Engineering Group S.p.a., a leading IT company in Italy, as a Junior Solution Developer, SpagoBI Team (R&D department â€“ Turin, Italy). After almost two years, I left Engineering Group S.p.a and Italy. Now I am living in Galway, Ireland. Here, I have worked for SAP Ireland, as a Software Developer in the Cloud Service Centre Team.
